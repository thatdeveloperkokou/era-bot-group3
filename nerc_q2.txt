 1.0 SUMMARY  
Pursuant to Section 34(1)(e) of the Electricity Act 2023 which states 
that "the Commission shall ensure the safety, security, reliability, and 
quality of service in the production and delivery of electricity to 
consumers”,  the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC or 
the Commission) continues to monitor the technical, operational, and 
commercial performance of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry 
(NESI). The Commission publishes quarterly reports to apprise t he 
public of the overall performan ce of the NESI.   
Operational Performance  
The operational performance parameters reported in 2025/Q2 
include the available generation capacity, plant availability factor, 
quarterly generation, load factor, and generation mix of the twenty -
eight (28)1 grid-connected power plants. Other parameters reported 
include the frequency, voltage, and overall stability performance of the 
National Grid during the quarter.  
a. Available Generation Capacity:  In 2025/Q2, there were twenty -
eight (28) grid -connected power plants consisting of five (5) hydro, two 
(2) steam, nineteen (19)  Open C ycle Gas Turbine (OCGT ), and two 
(2) Combined  Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT)  plants.  For this quarter, the 
average available generation capacity of the grid -connected power 
plants was 5,395.72MW.  This represents a  28.84MW  (+0.54% ) 
increase compared to the 5, 366.88 MW recorded in 2025/Q 1 (Figure 
A). Twelve (12) power plants attained  increases in available 
generation capacities for 2025/Q2 relative  to 2025/Q1.  
 
 
1 AES and Gbarain power plants are not included in the report because they are currently not operational. The 
Maiduguri Emergency Power Plant (MEPP) is currently not  operating in grid -connected mode.   The average 
available 
generation 
capacity in 
2025/Q 2 was 
5,395.72MW

Figure A: Available Generation Capacity (January - June 2025)  
b. Quarterly Generation:  The average hourly generation on the grid 
in 2025/Q2 was 4,501.06MWh/h, which translates to a total 
generation of 9,830.31GWh. The average hourly generation of the 
grid-connected power plants decreased by 269.53MWh/h ( -5.65%) 
from 4,770.59MWh/h in 2025/Q1. The total electricity generated in 
the quarter also decreased by 474.15GWh ( -4.60%)2 from 
10,304.47GWh in 2025/Q1 (Figure B). The decrease in energy 
generation during the quarter can be attributed to the decrease in 
energy offtake by the grid -connected customers (including DisCos) 
compared to 2025/Q1.      
c. Grid Performance:  In 2025/Q2, the average lower daily (49.33Hz) 
and average upper daily (50.78Hz) system frequencies were outside 
the normal operating limits (49.75Hz - 50.25Hz) but remained within 
the lower and higher bound stress limits (48.75Hz - 51.25Hz). The 
average lo wer daily system voltage (300.05kV) was outside the lower 
limit (313.50kV) while the average upper daily system voltage 
(345.31kV) was within the limit (346.50kV) specified in the grid code.  
 
2 The percentage change in total generation and average hourly generation is different across 202 5/Q1 and 
2025/Q 2 because the number of days in each of the quarters is not the same (9 0/91 days). When the number 
of days in the quarters being compared is the same, the percentage change in total generation will be the same 
as the percentage change in average hourly generation .

Commercial Performance  
The review of commercial performance for 202 5/Q2 covers energy 
offtake performance, energy accounting efficiency, billing efficiency, 
collection efficiency, aggregate technical, commercial, and collection 
loss, and the market remittance of relevant market participants.  
a. Energy Offtake Performance : In 202 5/Q2, the average energy 
offtake by DisCos at their trading points was 3, 582.62 MWh/h  which 
represents a  decrease of 199.3 2MWh/h ( -5.27%) compared to the  
average offtake  recorded in 202 5/Q1 (3,781.94 MWh/h ). 
Cumulatively, DisCos recorded an overall offtake performance of 
91.78%; the available  Partially Contracted Capacity  (PCC) during the 
quarter was 3,903.44 MWh/h.  
b. Energy Accounting  Efficiency:  Energy accounting efficiency (EAE) 
measures how effectively DisCos account for the energy they offtake at 
their trading points. Although the total energy received by all DisCos 
in 2025/Q2 was 7,824.43GWh, the energy billed to end -use 
customers was only 6,449.82GWh, translating into an overall energy 
accounting efficiency of 82.43%.

5   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 c. Billing Efficiency:  The naira value of the total energy offtake by all 
DisCos in 2025/Q2 was ₦909.59 billion, and the total energy billed 
was ₦742.34 billion, which translates to a billing efficiency of 81.61%. 
This means that at an aggregate level, DisCos were unable to account 
for ₦167.2 5 billion worth of energy received at their trading points in 
2025/Q2.  
c. Collection Efficiency:  The total revenue collected by all DisCos in 
2025/Q2 was ₦564.71  billion out of ₦742.34  billion billed to 
customers. This translates to a collection efficiency of 7 6.07%, 
representing a n increase of 1.68pp compared to 202 5/Q1 (74.39%).  
d. Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) Loss : The 
Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) loss is a 
summation of – i) billing losses incurred by a DisCo due to its inability 
to bill 100% of energy delivered to customers (technical and 
commercial losses); ii) collection losses arising fr om the DisCo’s 
inability to collect 100% of the bills issued to customers.  
The weighted average ATC&C loss across all DisCo in 202 5/Q2 was 
37.92 %, comprising technical and commercial loss (1 8.39%) and 
collection loss (2 3.93%). The ATC&C loss of 37.92 % is 17.38pp higher 
than the 2025 MYTO target (2 0.54%) and translates to a cumulative 
revenue loss of ₦158.053 billion across all DisCos.  The ATC&C loss 
decreased by 1.69pp (better performance) compared to 202 5/Q1 
(39.61%). All the DisCos except Eko  failed to achieve their target 
ATC&C  during the quarter , with Kaduna DisCo recording the worst 
underperformance relative to the target ATC&C (Actual – 70.98 % vs. 
target – 21.32%) (Figure C).  
e. Market remittance : In 202 5/Q2, the cumulative upstream invoice 
payable by DisCos was ₦417.35 billion, consisting of ₦348.66  billion 
for DRO -adjusted generation costs from NBET4 and ₦68.68  billion for 
transmission and administrative services by the Market Operator 
 
3 This represents 22% of the gross allowable revenues for all DisCos over the period (2025/Q2)  
4 The NBET invoice payable by the DisCos for 202 5/Q2 was only ₦348.66 billion  because the FGN has taken 
responsibility for ~ 60% (₦514.35 billion) of the total generation costs in the form of subsidies arising from the 
freezing of end -use customer tariffs at the r ates payable in  July 2024 . 
A total of 
₦564.71  
billion was 
collected by all 
DisCos in 
2025/Q 2 out 
of the ₦742.34 
billion billed to 
customers .  
 
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS

 (MO). Out of this amount, the DisCos collectively remitted a total sum 
of ₦399.20  billion (₦333.90  billion for NBET and ₦65.30  billion for 
MO) with an outstanding balance of ₦18.15  billion. This translates to 
a remittance performance of 95.65 % in 202 5/Q2 compared to the 
95.86 % recorded in 202 5/Q1. The disaggregated DisCo remittance 
performance to the market for 202 5/Q2 is presented in Figure D.  
 
Figure C: Target and Actual ATC&C losses for DisCos in 2025/Q 2      
f. Remittance by Special and Bilateral Customers : In 202 5/Q2, the six 
(6) international bilateral customers purchasing power from the grid -
connected GenCos made  a cumulative payment of $9.015 million 
against the $17.54 million invoice issued to them by the MO for 
services rendered in 2025/Q2 (remittance rate – 51.33 %). Similarly, 
the domestic bilateral customers made a cumulative payment of 
₦1,401.00  million against the ₦2,796.29 million invoice issued to them 
by the MO for services rendered in 2025/Q26 (remittance rate – 
50.10%).              
 
5 These remittances are based on reconciled market settlement submitted to the Commission as at 30 September 
2025  
6 A domestic bilateral customer made payments during 2025/Q2 for outstanding MO invoices from previous 
quarters. The details of these payments are contained in Appendix V III.

 2.0 STATE OF THE INDUSTRY  
Pursuant to Section 34(1)(e) of the Electricity Act (EA) 2023 which states that "the 
Commission shall ensure the safety, security, reliability, and quality of service in the 
production and delivery of electricity to consumers” , the Nigerian Electricity 
Regulatory Commission (NERC) continues to monitor the overall state of the 
Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI)  primarily across the three (3) underlisted 
areas – 
• Operational performance: a measure of how effectively available resources 
are utilised to generate electricity  
• Grid performance:  a measure of the technical performance of the national 
grid relative to the standards set out in the extant codes  
• Commercial performance:  a measure of the flow of funds from customers to 
upstream electricity industry players  
2.1 Operational Performance  
In evaluating the operational performance of the NESI, the following Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) are considered:   
• Available generation capacity  
• Plant availability factor   
• Quarterly generation   
• Generation load factor   
• Generation mix   
2.1.1 Available generation capacity  
In 2025/Q 2, there were twenty -eight (28) grid -connected power plants consisting 
of five (5) hydro, two (2) steam, nineteen (19) Open C ycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) 
and two (2) C ombined  Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plants. During the quarter,  the 
average available generation capacity of the grid -connected power plants 
increased by 28.84 MW (+ 0.54%) from the 5, 366.88MW recorded in 202 5/Q1 to 
5,395.72MW. Across the quarters, twelve  (12) out of the twenty -eight (28) grid-
connected power plants  recorded increases in available capacity, while the 
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
16   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 remaining fifteen (15) recorded decreases. The Alaoji power plant was unavailable 
throughout the quarter.  
The most significant increase in average available generation capacity in 2025/Q2 
compared to 2025/Q1 was recorded in Geregu_1 (+109.13%). Notable increases 
in available capacity across the quarters were also recorded in Zungeru_1 
(+31.09%), Ihovbor_1 (+30 .86%), Olorunsogo_2 (+25.43%), Trans Amadi_1 
(+24.77%), Ibom power_1 (+23.05%), and Egbin_1 (+16.69%) power plants.  
Conversely, there were significant decreases in the average available capacities of 
Rivers_1 ( -49.72%), Omoku_1 ( -44.72%), Odukpani_1 ( -35.65%), and Sapele 
Steam_1 ( -21.09%) power plants in 2025/Q2  compared to 2025/Q1 . Figure 1  
shows the plants with the highest average available capacities across the two 
quarters.  
 
Figure 1: Average Available Capacity (MW) in 2025/Q1 vs. 2025/Q2  
2.1.2   Plant availability factor  
The availability factor of a plant is measured as a ratio of the maximum rated output 
of the plant declared by the operator (available capacity) to the maximum rated 
output specified by the manufacturer (installed capacity). The available capacity of 
a plant may change from time to time due to several factors , including i) atmospheric 
conditions at the plant; ii) mechanical availability of the plant  (planned and

 unplanned outages); iii) feedstock availability, etc. The formula for the plant 
availability factor (PAF) is represented by equation 1:  
The plant availability factor (PAF) is a critical parameter for evaluating the overall 
health of the upstream segment of the NESI. In 202 5/Q2, the average plant 
availability factor for all grid -connected plants was 3 9.60%, i.e. at any point in time 
during the quarter, 60.40% of the installed capacity across the twenty -eight (28) 
grid-connected power plants was not available for dispatch onto the grid. Overall, 
ten (10) power plants had availability factors above 50% , with Ikeja_1 power plant 
recording the highest availability factor at 99. 34%. On the other end of the 
spectrum, Alaoji_1 recorded a PAF of 0% in 202 5/Q2, i.e. the plant was not 
available to dispatch any energy onto the grid throughout the quarter .  
The PAF of all the grid -connected plants is contained in Table 1. The gross PAF of 
39.60% recorded in 202 5/Q2 represents a 0.21pp increase  relative to the 3 9.39% 
PAF that was recorded in 202 5/Q1. Significant increases in PAF were recorded in 
Geregu_1 (+34.63pp), Zungeru_1 (+15.36pp), and Egbin_1 (+7.68pp) power 
plants across the two quarters.   
Conversely, the PAF of Odukpani_1 decreased significantly by 19.78pp during the 
quarter (35.72% in 2025/Q2 compared to 55.50% in 2025/Q1). Reductions in 
PAF were also recorded in Rivers_1 ( -14.60pp), Omoku_1 ( -11.58pp), and 
Olorunsogo ( -7.13pp) power plants .

2.1.3 Quarterly generation  
The hourly output produced by all the units in a power plant fluctuates based on 
grid demand, mechanical operability of the unit(s) , and the availability of feedstock. 
Plants are only dispatched when the load on the grid is sufficient to offtake the 
energy while  operating the grid within acceptable technical limits. The factors that 
determine the dispatch of a plant at any point in time include :   
• Plant availability (mechanical and feedstock)  
• Load offtake on the grid  
• Financial competitiveness of the plant in the economic merit order dispatch  
The average hourly generation on the grid in 202 5/Q2 was 4,501.06 MWh/h, 
which translates to a total generation of 9,830.31 GWh  (equation 2).  
Total generation = Ave. hourly generation  (MWh/h )×24hrs×  number of days in the quarter         (2)  
 
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
19   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 The average hourly generation and the total generation decreased by 5.65% and 
4.60%7 respectively in 2025/Q 2 compared to 202 5/Q1; the hourly generation 
decreased from 4, 770.59MWh/h generated in 202 5/Q1 to 4,501.06MWh/h ( -
269.53MWh/h), while the total generation decreased from 10,304.47GWh 
generated in 202 5/Q1 to 9,830.31GWh ( -474.15 GWh) in 2025/Q 2. The 
decrease in quarterly generation can be  attributed to a decrease in load offtake by 
the grid-connected  customers.   
In total, eighteen (18) plants recorded decreases in their average hourly generation 
across the quarters. Significant decreases in average hourly generation were 
recorded in Odukpani_1 ( -100.40MWh/h), Geregu_2 ( -81.47MWh/h), Delta_1 ( -
68.47MWh/h), Shiroro_ 1 (-46.07MWh/h), Afam_2 ( -34.77MWh/h) and Rivers_1 
(-31.40MWh/h) power plants.  
Conversely, increases in average hourly generation were recorded in Geregu_1 
(+97.29MWh/h) Egbin_1 (+87.30MWh/h), Ihovbor_1 (+15.11MWh/h), and 
Olorunsogo_2 (+12.58MWh/h) power plants across the quarters (Table 2 ).

2025/Q2 because the number of days in each of the quarters is not the same (90/91 days). When the number of 
days in the quarters being compared is the same, the percentage change in total generation will be the same as 
the percentage change in average hourly generation.

 The cumulative average hourly generation from  the grid -connected  thermal plants 
during the quarter also decreased by 201.38MWh/h ( -6.02%) in 2025/Q2, with 
fifteen  (15) out of the twenty -three (23) thermal plants recording decreases in their 
average hourly generation .  
2.1.4   Generation load factor  
The load factor is a measure of the utilisation of a power plant’s available capacity, 
calculated as the ratio of the average electricity generated over a period to the 
maximum possible generation (assuming all the available capacity is utilised all the 
time over the period). A higher load factor means better capacity utilisation thereby 
reducing the cost per unit of energy and increasing profitability, as fixed costs are 
spread over a larger amount of dispatched energy. The load factor (also known as 
the dispatch rate) reflects both the demand for energy and a plant’s ability to supply 
it. The formula for load factor is represented by equation 3:  
The overall load factor for all grid -connected power plants in 202 5/Q2 was 
83.42% ; meaning that on average, at any point during the quarter, 16.58% of 
available capacity was not dispatched. The load factor in 202 5/Q2 (83.42%) 
represents  a 5.47pp decrease compared to the 88.89 % load factor recorded in 
2025/Q1.  
The load factors of the seven (7) power plants with the highest dispatch rates in 
2025/Q2 are presented in Figure 3. T hree (3) power plants (Trans Amadi_1, 
Igbafo_1, and Omoku_1 ) recorded dispatch rates of 100%. Kainji_1 and Dadin 
Kowa_1 hydropower plants recorded load factors >90% (93.04% and 99.01% 
respectively), while the remaining three hydropower plants (Shiroro_1, Jebba_1, 
and Zungeru_1) recorded dispatch rates < 90% (74.79%, 74.42%, and 70.47%, 
respectively). The <90% dispatch rate recorded by Shiroro_1, Jebba_1, and 
Zungeru_1 during the quarter  is inconsistent with the Commission’s Order on the 
Mandatory dispatch of Hydropower Plants in the NESI (Order No: 
NERC/18 2/20198).

2.1.5 Generation mix  
The electricity generation mix refers to the combination of fuels used to generate 
electricity over a period. The electricity generation mix varies across countries and  
is influenced by factors such as natural resource availability, government policies, 
environmental considerations, type of power plants, energy demand,  and seasonal 
fluctuations. An ideal energy mix must balance the three key elements of the energy 
trilemma: i) Energy Security9 ii) Energy Sustainability10; and iii) Energy 
Affordability/Equity11. The formula for the share of electricity generated by fuel 
source is given by equation 4:  
The share of electricity generated from different fuel sources in 202 5/Q1 and 
2025/Q 2 is presented in Figure 4 . The total generation from hydropower plants 
(2,967.28 GWh) decreased by 114.59GWh ( -3.72%) in 2025/Q 2 compared to 
2025/Q1 (3,081.88 GWh). The contribution of hydropower plants to the energy

represents a +0.28 pp change compared to its contribution in 202 5/Q1 (29.91%). 
The increase in the contribution of hydropower plants to the energy mix during 
2025/Q2 despite a decrease in total generation from the plants, is due to the 
significant decrease in the overall energy generated in the quarter (section 2.1.3)  
and the decrease in the total energy generated by thermal power plants in 
2025/Q2 compared to 2025/Q1 .

The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which has the responsibility of 
transporting energy from power plants to DisCos, has been operating with two (2) 
licences: Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and System Operator (SO). However, 
the EA 2023 provide s for the incorporation of an entity to be licenced as an 
Independent System Operator (ISO) to perform the market and system operator 
functions of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).

 The NISO was inaugurated on 08 April 2025 and has fully commenced market and 
system operations, while the Transmission Service Provider (TSP) responsibility 
remains with TCN.  The key functions of the NISO include:  
• System Operations: these include maintaining system stability, generation 
scheduling, transmission scheduling, load balance and load dispatch.  
• System Planning: Entails the procurement and scheduling of ancillary services 
and system planning for long -term captivity . 
• Market Operations: Administration of the wholesale electricity market in 
accordance with the Market Rules, and such other activities as may be 
required for reliable and efficient system operation  
To assess the performance of the grid, the Commission focuses on the following four 
(4) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that relate to power transmission:  
• Transmission loss factor  
• Stability of grid frequency  
• Voltage fluctuation  
• Incidence (s) of system collapse  
2.2.1 Transmission loss factor  
Transmission Loss Factor (TLF) refers to the proportion of the total energy sent out 
by the power plants that was either lost in transmission or utilised in the transmission 
station , i.e., neither delivered to the DisCos nor exported to international customers. 
There is an inverse relationship between the TLF and the efficiency of the transmission 
system; i.e. a decline in the TLF indicates an improvement in transmission efficiency 
over a given period. The formula for TLF is represented by equation 5:  
 
The average TLF in 2025/Q2  was 8.58% (Figure 5). A TLF of 8.58% indicates that 
for every 100MWh of energy injected into the grid, 8.58MWh of energy is 
undelivered to DisCos and international customers due to losses in the transmission 
network or consumption at the transmission substations. The TLF recorded in 
2025/Q2  represents a 0. 42pp decrease  (performance improvement ) relative to the 
9.00% recorded in 202 5/Q1. TLF  =  (1- Energy delivered to all DisCos+Energy Exported
Energy Sent out by all GenCos)  ×100                 (5)

Figure 5: Actual Transmission Loss Factor (%) vs. MYTO TLF Target (%) January - 
June 2025  
The 8.58% TLF recorded in 2025/Q2  represents an underperformance of 1.58pp 
relative to the MYTO target for 2025 – 7.00%. The TLF target represents the efficient 
loss in transmission  that is recoverable from customers based on the approved 
revenue requirements of the Transmission Service Provider  (TSP).  Exceeding the TLF 
target means that the TSP will not be able to earn its full revenue requirement 
because there is no provision to recover the revenues needed to cover the excess 
(inefficient) losses  from cus tomers.  The cost of the 1.58pp TLF underperformance  
during the quarter  to the TSP/TCN is ₦17.97 billion12 .  
2.2.2 Grid frequency  
Frequency is a crucial power quality parameter that industrial customers are 
particularly concerned about due to the sensitivity of their heavy -duty machinery. In 
industrial production assembly lines, the machines are designed to operate only 
within pre -set frequency limits and therefore often have a low tolerance for 
frequency fluctuations.  
As specified in section 10.1.2 of the Grid Code, the standard frequency for 
operation on the Grid is 50Hz. The code provides that under normal circumstances,

 the grid can operate within a deviation of ±0.5% , i.e. between a lower limit of 
49.75Hz and an upper limit of 50.25Hz. Section 10.1.2 of the Grid Code further 
provides that in extreme circumstances, the grid may operate within a tolerance  of 
±2.5% , i.e. system frequency may reach a lower bound stress limit of 48.75Hz and 
an upper bound stress limit of 51.25Hz.  
A system’s stability over a given period is measured by its ability to operate as close 
as possible to the 50Hz benchmark set in the Grid Code; this means that the lower 
the range between the average upper daily system frequency  and the average 
lower daily system frequency, the more stable the system has been.  
During 202 5/Q2, the average lower daily system frequency was 49. 33Hz, while 
the average upper daily system frequency was  50.78Hz, which translates to a range 
of 1.46Hz (Figure 6 ). Comparatively, in 202 5/Q1, the average lower daily system 
frequency was 49. 28Hz, while the average upper daily system frequency was 
50.77Hz, which translated to a range of 1. 49Hz. The 0. 03Hz ( -2.29% ) decrease in 
the average quarterly frequency range recorded in 202 5/Q2 relative to 202 5/Q1 
indicates a better operational performance  of the National Grid during 2025/Q2 .

 2.2.3 Voltage fluctuation  
To guarantee the quality of electricity delivered to end users, the Grid Code specifies 
a nominal system voltage of 330kV with a tolerance range of ±5% (313.50kV to 
346.50kV in the lower and upper bounds , respectively). Fluctuations in grid voltage, 
including spikes, dips, flickers, and brownouts, can cause significant harm to 
consumers and result in substantial commercial losses. Extreme cases of voltage 
fluctuations, particularly at the distribution netw ork level , can cause severe damage 
to industrial machines , thereby compelling industrial customers to seek alternative 
sources of power outside of the National Grid.  
The system voltage pattern from January to  June 2025 is illustrated in  Figure 7 . The 
average lower and upper  operating voltage for the transmission network in 
2025/Q2 were 300.05kV and 345.31 kV, respectively . The average upper 
operating voltage recorded during the quarter (345.13kV) was below the upper 
limit (346.50kV) specified in the grid code. As explained for frequency in section 
2.2.2,  the measure of the health of a system over a given period can also be 
evaluated based on the range between the average upper daily system voltage and 
the average lower daily system voltage. The lower the range,  the more stable the 
system is.  
By way of comparison, the range between the Grid’s average lower and upper 
operating voltage for 2025/Q 2 was 45.26kV which is lower than the 5 0.26kV 
(average lower and upper voltages of 296.56kV and 346.82 kV respectively) that 
was recorded in 202 5/Q1, further reinforcing the observation  reported in section 
2.2.2 that the quality of energy transported along the National grid was higher in 
2025/Q2.  
The Commission continues to engage with TCN and other stakeholders to ensure 
sustained efforts at keeping the system voltage within the limits  contained in the grid 
code and consequently providing a safe and reliable electricity supply to end users.

Figure 7: System Voltage (kV) from January - June 2025  
2.2.4 System collapse  
The national power grid is a vast network of electrical transmission lines that link 
power stations to end -use customers across the nation and is designed to function 
within specific stability boundaries, including voltage (330kV ± 5.0%) and frequency 
(50H z ± 0.5%). Any deviation from these stability ranges can result in decreased 
power quality and , in severe cases, cause widespread power outages ranging from 
a partial collapse of a section of the grid to a full system -wide blackout.  
While the NISO is responsible for ensuring that various parameters are maintained 
within their respective tolerance limits, the primary parameter that the NISO tracks 
to avoid system disturbances is frequency. When electricity demand exceeds supply, 
the grid frequency decreases . Conversely, if supply surpasses demand, the 
frequency increases. In reaction to the grid operating at a frequency outside of the 
normal operation range (especially when the frequency is too low), safety settings 
on generation units can cause the units to  shut down. This response can exacerbate 
the frequency imbalance, potentially triggering a cascade of further shutdowns 
across generation units and leading to  a full or partial system collapse. There was 
no incidence of system disturbance on the National G rid in 2025/Q2.

 2.3 Commercial Performance  
The commercial performance of the NESI is a measure of the flow of funds from 
customers to upstream electricity industry players. In evaluating the commercial 
performance of the NESI for 202 5/Q2, the following parameters are considered:  
• Energy offtake performance  
• Energy Accounting Efficiency  
• Energy billed and billing efficiency  
• Revenue and collection efficiency  
• Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) loss  
• Remittances to the Market Operator (MO) and the Nigerian Bulk 
Electricity Trading Company (NBET).  
2.3.1 Energy offtake performance  
The Partial Activation of Contract (PAC) regime, which took effect in July 2022, 
defines the target volume of energy to be off taken by DisCos at any time as their 
Partially Contracted Capacity (PCC). As explained in prior reports, under the PAC 
regime, Di sCos have “take-or-pay” obligations on their PCC , which means that they 
must pay for available capacity irrespective of their offtake. This structure is 
consistent with international best practices for long -term contract -based power 
procurement and ensures  that GenCos earn capacity payments ( adequate to cover 
fixed costs) to compensate them for making their generation units available.  
The PAC regime also mandates GenCos or TCN to compensate DisCos through 
Liquidated Damages (LDs) in the event of capacity shortfalls. Under the single -buyer 
model being operated in the NESI, when there is a shortfall in generation, LDs from 
GenCos are trea ted as net -offs in the invoices issued to NBET , thereby reducing the 
net payables due from DisCos.  
When there is sufficient generation capacity  and the transmission network is able to 
deliver the required energy to each DisCo’s trading points , every DisCo will be 
directed by the NISO to offtake its entire PCC13. When generation falls below the 
required target, the NISO prorates the available capacity among all DisCos or 
 
13 DisCos may get less than their PCC in instances where there are transmission network limitations  
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
30   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 allocates energy to the DisCos based on any extant regulatory directive issued by 
the Commission14; this determines the “Available PCC”  for each DisCo .  
The ratio between a DisCo’s energy offtake and the available PCC is known as the 
“energy offtake performance”. The formula for determining a DisCo’s energy 
offtake performance is represented by equation 6:  
 
Considering the large disparity between the energy on the national grid and 
customer demand, it is expected that DisCos will always offtake 100% of their 
available PCC. It is noteworthy that when DisCos have offtake ratios below 100%, 
they incur increased wholesale energy costs as they still must pay NBET/GenCos for 
unutilised capacity. The tariff methodology utilised by the Commission does not allow 
DisCos to recover the resultant additional wholesale energy costs (relative to the 
volume of energy off -taken) from customers.  
In 2025/Q2, the average energy offtake by DisCos at their trading points was 
3,582.62MWh/h, which represents a decrease of 199.33MWh/h ( -5.27%) when 
compared to the average offtake  in 2025/Q1 ( 3,781.94MWh /h). This reduction in 
energy off -take was despite an overall increase in available energy across the 
quarters (Available PCC: 2025/Q2 - 3,903.44MWh/h vs. 2025/Q1 - 
3,861.53MWh/h ). All DisCos except Benin recorded a decline in their offtake 
performance between 2025/Q1 and 2025/Q2  (Table 3 ). 
On an aggregate level, the available PCC increased marginally by 1.09% while the 
gross energy offtake decreased by 5.27% between 2025/Q1 and 2025/Q2. The 
cumulative energy offtake performance of DisCos during the quarter was 9 1.78%; 
this translates to a 6.1 6pp decline in the energy offtake performance of the DisCos 
relative to 202 5/Q1 (97.94%). The resultant differential between the regulatory set 
wholesale generation cost and the actual cost incurred by the DisCos arising from 
poor energy offtake is borne entirely by the DisCo; deemed capacity expenses are 
not passed onto customers.   
 
14 The Commission issued a guideline to the NISO in May 2025,  which specifies the allocation to be implemented 
by the NISO in cases of available generation shortfall. The guideline allows the NISO to deviate from the pro -
rated allocation of available generation to all DisCos.  Energy Offtake performance (%)    =     ( Energy Offtake
Available PCC)  ×  100                  (6)

2.3.2   Energy Accounting Efficiency  
Energy accounting efficiency (EAE) measures how effectively DisCos account for the 
energy they offtake at their trading points. It is measured as the proportion of  energy 
billed (GWh) to customers (including metered and unmetered customers) relative to 
the total energy supplied (GWh) to a given area over a period.  It is the measure 
of billing efficiency (details in section 2.3.3) using energy rather than commercial 
parameters.  
All things being equal, it is expected that there will be a high correlation (similarity) 
between the EAE and commercial billing efficiency  (BE). However, due to the SBT 
regime that is in place in the NESI and the large differential between the rates 
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
32   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 charged across the various bands, the expected direct correlation between the EAE 
and the commercial billing efficiency is not guaranteed.  
Accordingly, the EAE helps to evaluate how well a DisCo is performing when it 
comes to its ability to – i) manage technical losses incurred along its network; ii) 
track the flow and delivery of electricity across its network. The formula for energy 
accounting  efficiency is represented by equation 7 . An energy accounting  efficiency 
of 70% means that  if a DisCo offtakes/distributes 100GWh  worth of electricity , it is 
only able to bill its customers for  70GWh.  
 
The total energy offtake by all DisCos in 202 5/Q2 was 7,824.43 GWh, and the 
total energy billed was 6 ,449.82 GWh, which translates to a n energy accounting  
efficiency of 8 2.43%. Comparatively, the total energy received and billed in 
2025/Q1 were 8,169.00 GWh and 6, 631.92 GWh, respectively, which translated 
to an efficiency of 8 1.18%. This means that at an aggregate level, DisCos recorded 
a 1.25 pp increase in energy accounting  efficiency15 between 202 5/Q1 and 
2025/Q2. 
The disaggregated performance of the DisCos shows that Benin DisCo recorded the 
highest energy accounting  efficiency of 91.17 %, while Yola DisCo recorded the 
lowest efficiency of 67.96 %. A quarter -on-quarter comparison of energy accounting  
efficiency shows that six (6) DisCos recorded improvements in their energy 
accounting  efficiencies in 202 5/Q2 relative to 202 5/Q1, with Kaduna (+14.82pp) 
recording the greatest improvement.  Conversely, Ibadan, Enugu, Eko, Port Harcourt 
and Yola recorded decreases in energ y accounting  efficiency , with Yola recording 
the most significant decrease of 9.62pp (Table 4 ). 
DisCos have the responsibility of developing strategies to improve their energy 
accounting  efficiencies. These can include reinforcing DisCos’ infrastructure to 
reduce technical losses, improving consumer enumeration and customer service, 
improving the metering rate and rolling out initiatives to curb energy theft.  
 
15 The methodology for determining Energy accounting efficiency is the same as what was used to determine 
Billing efficiency in prior reports. Commencing 2025/Q2 (this report), the Commission will determine the Billing 
Efficiency of DisCos using commercial p arameters (Section 2.3.3).  Energy Accounting Efficiency  =( Total energy billed to customers (GWh)
Total energy received by the network (GWh)) × 100             (7)

2.3.3 Billing Efficiency  
Billing efficiency (BE) of a DisCo is a measure of the ratio of the naira value of 
energy billed by the DisCo to customers relative to the naira value of  the total energy 
supplied to a given area over a period. The key drivers of billing losses are i) 
technical - energy loss along the distribution network , and ii) commercial - DisCo's 
inability to account for 100% of the energy supplied. Commercial losses could either 
be a result of theft on the part of the customer, i.e., a meter bypass, or other factors 
under the DisCo’s control, such as poor customer enumeration and the proliferation 
of inaccurate meters. A billing efficiency of 70% means that  if a DisCo delivers 
₦100.00 worth of electricity  to customers, it is only able to issue bills worth ₦70.00 
due to commercial losses . The formula for billing efficiency is represented by 
equation 8:  
 
The naira value of the  total energy off tak en by all DisCos in 202 5/Q2 was ₦909.59  
billion , and the naira value of the total energy billed was ₦742.34 billion , which 
translates to a billing efficiency of 8 1.61%. This means that at an aggregate level, 
DisCos’ energy accounting inefficiencies, as well as the allocation of energy to the 
different customer classes/bands, resulted in a billing shortfall of ₦167.2 5 billion .  Billing Efficiency = ( Total energy billed to customers ( ₦)
Total energy received by the network (kWh) x Average Allowed Tariff ( ₦/kWh)) × 100    (8)  
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
34   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 The disaggregated performance of the DisCos shows that Eko DisCo recorded the 
highest billing efficiency of 96.67 %, while Yola DisCo recorded the lowest billing 
efficiency of 58.38%  (Table 5 ).

It is expected that if DisCos allocate energy across bands (Bands A -E) as stipulated 
in the MYTO framework issued by the Commission , while also maintain ing a 
consistent EAE across the bands, the differential (variance) between  BE and EAE 
should be minimal ( i.e. BE – EAE variance is within a  ±2pp  limit16). Consequently, if 
a DisCo records  a “BE – EAE”  variance  greater than +2pp, it indicates that 
allocation of energy was skewed to the more commercially viable feeders  with high 
energy accounting efficiency. Conversely, if a DisCo records  a “BE – EAE” variance 
less than -2pp, it indicates that energy allocation was skewed to less commercially 
viable feeders  with poor energy accounting  efficiency .  
The d isaggregated “BE – EAE”  variance performance of the DisCos show ed that 
only Port Harcourt DisCo recorded a va riance within  ±2pp limit between B E and 
EAE ( +0.14pp) , i.e. PHED was the only DisCo that largely delivered energy across 
its bands based on the MYTO while also recording a consistent level of EAE across 
the feeders.   
 
16 The Commission has adopted ±2pp as a limit because it gives ˜5% allowance for the average performance 
of DisCos.

35   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 Eko (+9.22pp) and Kano (+9.07pp) DisCos recorded significant positive “BE – 
EAE” variances , indicating that they skewed their energy delivery to more 
commercially viable feeders while also potentially recording higher EAE on those 
feeders. Conversely, Benin ( -21.51pp), Kaduna ( -19.77pp) , and Ibadan ( -15.40pp) 
DisCos recorded significant negative “BE – EAE” variances, indicating that their 
energy delivery skewed towards less commercially viable feeders,  while also 
recording lower EAE on the more commercially viable feeders  (Table 6) .

2.3.4 Revenue and collection efficiency  
Collection efficiency is the ratio of the amount that has been collected from customers 
relative to the amount billed to them by the DisCos. The significant under -recovery 
of the invoices issued to customers by DisCos is driven by a lack of willingness of 
customers to pay bills when due, customer dissatisfaction with DisCos’ services and 
inadequate customer metering, among other challenges. A collection efficiency of 
70% implies that for every ₦100.00 worth  of energy billed to customers by DisCos,  
only ₦70.00  was recovered from the billed customers. The formula for collection 
efficiency is represented by equation 9: 
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
36   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
  
The total revenue collected by all DisCos in 2025/Q2 was ₦564.71 billion out of 
the ₦742.34 billion that was billed to customers. This translates to a collection 
efficiency of 7 6.07%. In comparison, the total revenue collected by all DisCos in 
2025/Q1 was ₦553.63 billion out of the ₦744.26 billion billed to customers, which 
translated to a 74.39% collection efficiency. This means that at an aggregate level, 
DisCos recorded a 1.68 pp increase in collection  efficiency between 202 5/Q1 and 
2025/Q2. 
The summary of the revenue collection performance of all DisCos is contained in 
Table 7. In 2025/Q2, three (3) DisCos recorded collection efficiencies greater than 
80% with Eko (87.80%) recording the highest collection efficiency.  Conversely, Jos 
DisCo recorded the lowest collection efficiency at 4 3.82%. A comparison of DisCos'  
performance shows that  Port Harcourt (+9.79pp), Benin (+5.04pp), Ikeja 
(+4.89pp), Ibadan (+4.20pp), Eko (+3.01pp) and Yola (+0.88pp) DisCos recorded 
improvements in collection effici ency between 202 5/Q1 and 202 5/Q2. 
Conversely, the remaining five (5) DisCos recorded declines in collection efficiency , 
with Abuja ( -3.93pp) and Jos ( -3.37pp)  DisCos having the most significant declines 
across  the quarters .

SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
37   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 In 2025/Q2, energy accounting17 and collection efficiencies increased by 1.25pp 
and 1.68pp, respectively, compared  to 2025/Q1. Based on historical trends, this 
increase in efficiencies across the two quarters can be attributed to the decreased 
energy offtake ( -4.22%) during the quarter compared to 2025/Q1. It has been 
observed that there is an inverse relationship bet ween DisCos’ energy offtake and 
their energy accounting /collection efficiencies. Typically, when DisCos offtake less 
energy, they often prioritise  areas where they record historically lower energy 
accounting  and collection inefficiencies.  
The most proven methods to improve energy accounting and revenue recovery are 
accurate customer enumeration and the installation of end -use customer meters.  The 
Commission issued the Order on the operationalisation of Tranche A of the Meter 
Acquisition Fund (MAF)  in 2024/Q2. The Order, which became effective on 24 June 
2024, directed DisCos to utilise the first tranche of disbursement from the MAF 
scheme to procure and install meters for unmetered Band A customers within their 
franchise areas.  
As of June 2025, DisCos have metered more than 107,000 Band A customers 
through the MAF scheme. In addition to the MAF, DisCos are expected to continue 
to utilise any of the metering frameworks provided for in the NERC MAP and NMMP  
metering regulation (2021) to improve end -use customer metering in their franchise 
areas. This will reduce commercial and collection losses, thereby improving the flow 
of funds to upstream market participants in the NESI.  
2.3.5 Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) Loss  
The Aggregate Technical, Commercial and Collection (ATC&C) loss is a summation 
of – i) billing losses incurred by a DisCo due to its inability to  account for and  bill 
100% of energy delivered to customers (technical and commercial losses); and ii) 
collection losses arising from the DisCo’s inability to collect 100% of the bills issued 
to customers. The ATC&C loss is a critical performance -setting parameter for tar iff 
computation , as the MYTO makes allowance for target ATC&C loss levels for each 
DisCo.  
The target ATC&C reflects the efficient operational losses which the DisCo is 
expected to incur in its operations , and this is recoverable from its allowed tariffs. 
The target ATC&C usually reduces over time as DisCos make investments that are 
 
17 2025/Q1 value for Energy Accounting is Billing Efficiency in the 2025/Q1 report.  
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
38   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 geared towards improving operational efficiency. ATC&C loss is made up of the 
following components:  
1. Technical Loss: heat loss due to load flow in electrical lines and transformation 
loss in transformers.  
2. Commercial Loss: due to discrepancies in meter reading, erroneous billing, 
unmetered consumption, or energy theft . 
3. Collection Loss: unpaid bills.  
The formula for ATC&C loss is represented by equation 10:  
 
Any DisCo that can outperform its allowed ATC&C (i.e. has a lower actual ATC&C 
than the target used to compute its cost -reflective tariff) will earn more returns on its 
set tariffs. Conversely, any DisCo that fails to meet its allowed ATC&C (i.e. has a 
higher actual ATC&C than the target) will not be able to earn the total revenue 
requirement upon which its tariffs have been determined; this could pose risks to its 
long-term financial position.  
The aggregate ATC&C loss recorded across all DisCos in 202 5/Q2 was 37.92 %, 
which comprised 1 8.39% in technical and commercial losses and 2 3.93% in 
collection loss ( Table 8). The aggregate ATC&C loss of 37.92 % recorded in 
2025/Q2 is 17.38pp higher than the allowed aggregate efficient loss target 
(20.54%) applied in the computation of the tariffs in the MYTO for the year 202 5 
and translates to a cumulative revenue loss of ₦158.05  billion18 for the DisCos.  The 
revenue loss in 2025/Q2 was lower than in 2025/Q1 ( ₦200.49  billion ) because 
DisCos were able to reduce the variance between the target and actual ATC&C loss 
from 19.07pp in 2025/Q1 to 17.38pp in 2025/Q2.  
Disaggregated performance of the DisCos showed that Eko DisCo surpassed its 
ATC&C loss target by 1.76pp (Actual – 15.12% vs. target – 16.88%) and earned 
₦2.19 billion  more on its set tariffs (gross allowable revenue). Conversely, the 
remaining ten (10) DisCos failed to achieve their ATC&C loss targets in 2025/Q2. 
Kaduna DisCo recorded the widest ATC&C variance (target – actual) of -49.66pp, 
translating to a revenue los s of ₦21.68  billion . Abuja ( ₦22.75  billion ) and Ibadan 
(₦23.12  billion ) DisCos also record ed revenue losses greater than ₦20.00  billion  
 
 18 This represents 22% of the  gross  recoverable  revenues for all DisCos over the period (2025/Q2)       ATC&C Loss =  [1 - (Billing Efficiency  × Collection Efficiency )] × 100           (10)

39   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 due to their inability to achieve the target ATC&C losses specified in the MYTO 
(Table 8). The excess ATC&C losses (inefficiencies) incurred by the DisCos are not 
recoverable from customers and may compromise the long -term financial positions 
of the affected DisCos.  
As stated above, t he average ATC&C loss recorded in 202 5/Q2 (37.92 %) was 
1.69pp lower  (better  performance) than what was recorded in 202 5/Q1 (39.61%). 
Seven (7) DisCos recorded improvements in their ATC&C loss performance in 
2025/Q2 compared to 202 5/Q1, with Eko  (-9.52pp) and Ikeja (-9.51pp) DisCos 
record ing the greatest  improvements . Conversely,  Benin (+11.35pp),  Yola 
(+10.40pp), Ibadan (+8.49pp) and Kaduna (+2.42pp) DisCos recorded declines 
in their ATC&C loss performance  between the two quarters  (Table 8).

 2.3.6 Market Remittance   
Under the account administration mechanism set up by the CBN in 2014 as part of 
the Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF) intervention, all the 
collections of the DisCos are escrowed. The DisCos only have access to their 
revenues after  relevant deductions towards their loan obligations have been made. 
This escrow mechanism also provides visibility into the financial performance of the 
DisCos with respect to collections.  
In June 2020, the remit of the fund manager responsible for the escrow was 
expanded to include the implementation of the payment waterfall framework which 
was designed by the Commission to increase upstream market remittance to NBET 
and NISO . This was to cover the cost of energy taken from GenCos, transmission 
charges (payable to the TSP) and the MO’s administrative charges.  
Prompt payment of upstream invoices is critical for securing the availability of 
generation and transmission capacities. The waterfall regime pushes DisCos to boost 
their collections because most of their allowed revenues rank below the payment of 
market o bligations in the waterfall.  
2.3.6.1 Market Remittance to NBET  
In the absence of cost -reflective tariffs, the Government undertakes to cover the 
resultant gap (between the cost -reflective and allowed tariff) in the form of tariff 
subsidies. For ease of administration, the subsidy is only applied to the generation 
cost payable by DisCos to NBET at source in the form of a DisCo’s Remittance 
Obligation (DRO). The DRO represents the total GenCo invoice that is billed to the 
DisCos by NBET based on what the allowed DisCo tariffs can cover19. Furthermore, 
DisCos are expected to remit 100% of the invoices received from the MO for 
transmission and administrative service costs.  
As explained in prior reports, the DRO regime replaced the Minimum Remittance 
Obligation20 (MRO) framework in January 2024, and DisCos are expected to pay 
100% of their DROs. The transition to the DRO regime was necessitated by the risk 
 
19 The outstanding portion of the GenCo invoice not covered by allowed tariffs and thus not billed to the DisCos 
is to be covered by the FGN in the form of tariff subsidies.  
20 Under the MRO regime , DisCos were invoiced 100% of the energy cost but were only expected to pay the 
MRO share of the invoice . The outstanding balance is only cleared from the DisCo’s record when the FGN 
subsidy is paid to NBET.  
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS

 of unpaid tariff subsidy debts encumbering the balance sheets of the DisCos, thereby 
preventing them from raising finance to undertake critical investments in their 
distribution network. Under the DRO framework , NBET directly invoices  the portion 
of GenCo costs not covered by DRO (tariff subsidy) to the Federal Ministry of 
Finance  for immediate settlement .  
The total amount invoiced by the GenCos for energy delivered to each DisCo and 
the DRO -adjusted NBET invoice  to the respective DisCos during 202 5/Q2 are 
summarised in Table 9. It is important to note that due to the absence of cost -
reflective tariffs across all DisCos, the Government incurred a subsidy obligation of 
₦514.35  billion21; this represents a ₦22.04  billion  (-4.11%) reduction in FGN 
subsidy compared to 2025/Q1 ( ₦536.40 billion )22.  
Although the subsidy obligation of the government decreased in naira terms ( - 
₦22.04 billion), it accounted for 59.60% of the total GenCo invoice, which is a 
0.44pp increase compared to 2025/Q1 when subsidy accounted for 59.16% of the 
total GenCo invoice23. This is because the actual generation cost ( ₦/kWh) increased 
by 0.59%, while the allowed end -user tariffs remained  unchanged across the 
quarters.

22 4.22% reduction in energy offtake by DisCos between 2025/Q2 and 2025/Q1  was the key driver for the 
reduction in the total GenCo invoice ( ₦863.02 billion vs. ₦906.77 billion) and subsidy ( ₦514.35 billion vs. 
₦536.40 billion) across the period.  
23 The current open -ended subsidy regime leaves the FGN exposed to indeterminate subsidy obligation because 
of i) volumetric risk; ii) generation cost variation arising from changes in supply mix (more thermal = higher 
generation cost).

 2.3.6.2 Market Remittance to MO  
The Market Operator issues invoices to DisCos for energy transmission and 
administrative services. In 2025/Q2, DisCos made a total remittance of ₦65.30  
billion against the cumulative invoice of ₦68.68  billion issued by the MO. This 
payment translates to 95.07 % remittance performance and is a 1.25pp decrease 
when compared to 96.32% remittance performance recorded in 2025/Q1 when 
DisCos remitted ₦59.49 billion out of ₦61.76 billion invoice issued by the MO . 
The disaggregated remittance performance of the DisCos  to the MO shows that, 
similar to 2025/Q1, all the DisCos except Jos (64.67%) and Kaduna (51.92%) 
recorded 100% remittance performance to the MO in 2025/Q2 (Figure 9). 
Between 202 5/Q1 and 2025/Q 2, Jos (-7.40pp) and Kaduna ( -0.28pp) DisCos 
recorded declines  in their remittance performance to MO .

2.3.6.4 Market Remittance by Other Customers  
The remittances made by bilateral customers (domestic and international) and 
special customers for invoices issued in 202 5/Q2 by the MO are detailed in  Table 
11. The six (6) international bilateral customers being supplied by GenCos in the 
NESI made a payment of $9.01 million against the cumulative invoice of $1 7.54 
million issued by the MO for services rendered in 202 5/Q2, translating to a 
remittance performance of 51.33 %. The domestic bilateral customers made a 
cumulative payment of ₦1,401.00 million against the invoice of ₦2,796.29  million 
issued to them by the MO for services rendered in 202 5/Q2, translating to 50.10 % 
remittance performance.  
It is noteworthy that one (1)  domestic bilateral customer made payments during 
2025/Q2 for outstanding MO invoices from previous quarters. The MO received 
₦10.53  million from Trans -Amadi (OAU/FMPI)  towards outstanding invoices from 
previous quarters. The details of the  payment are contained in Appendix V III. 
The special customer (Ajaokuta Steel Co. Ltd and the host community) did not make 
any payment towards the ₦1.27 billion (NBET) and ₦0.12 billion (MO) invoices 
received in 2025/Q2. This continues a longstanding trend of non -payment by this 
customer, and the Commission has communicated the need for intervention on this 
issue to the relevant FGN authorities.

 4.0 CONSUMER AFFAIRS  
4.1 Consumer Enlightenment and Stakeholder Engagements  
The Commission’s main consumer education and enlightenment mechanisms are 
town hall meetings and customer complaints resolution meetings. These are used to 
inform consumers and stakeholders about the Commission’s activities, regulatory 
instruments, consume r rights, and obligations, and to ensure the swift resolution of 
complaints. These also provide avenues for the Commission to gather feedback from 
a broad array of stakeholders , which is beneficial to the Commission in its decision -
making processes.  
Periodically, the  Commission also engages with relevant stakeholders and the 
broader public to inform them about its activities and provide general updates on 
the NESI.  The main avenues for the interface between the Commission and 
stakeholders are:  
• NESI stakeholder meetings  
• Trainings/Workshops  
• General stakeholder engagement activities  
The details of these engagements are shared with the public via the Commission’s 
social media accounts ( LinkedIn , X and Instagram ). In addition to being utilised to 
provide updates on the Commission’s engagement activities, the social media 
channels are also used to address relevant issues, including:  
• Consumer rights and obligations  
• Service delivery standards  
• NESI performance factsheets  
• Regulatory instruments issued by the Commission  
• Summary of the  Commission’s  statutory reports  
In 2025/Q2, the Commission held one (1) town hall meeting in Bauchi (26 -28 June 
2025). Some of the major issues that were discussed at the town hall meeting 
include:  
• Serviced -Based  Tariff (SBT) provisions   
• Capping of estimated bills for unmetered customers  
• Electricity customer rights and obligations   
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS

 • Electricity customer redress mechanisms   
• Unauthorised electricity access   
• Metering frameworks and  
• Strategies by the Commission to ensure improved overall service delivery 
to customers.    
The Commission also continued to sponsor jingles across radio stations throughout 
the country. These jingles educate customers on complaint redress mechanisms and 
provide addresses of NERC Forum Offices.

4.3 Customer Complaints  
In furtherance of its mandate as contained in section 119(1)(c) of the EA 2023 which 
states that “ the Commission shall develop in consultation with licensees, the customer 
complaints handling standard and procedure ”, the Commission provides various 
channels for customers to lodge complaints against their service providers. The 
primary channels available for customers to lodge complaints in the NESI are:  
A. NERC Customer Complaint Unit (NERC -CCU) : This is a unit at the Consumer 
Affairs Division of the Commission dedicated to receiving complaints directly from 
customers. Customers can lodge complaints at the NERC -CCU via emails, letters or 
phone calls (through the NESI Call Centre). Once complaints  are received by the 
Commission, they are passed on to the DisCos who are the parties responsible for 
resolution. There is a case management system through which DisCos provide 
 
34 The MAF  provides regulatory -backed long -tenor financing for the procurement of meters. A proportionate 
amount is deducted from DisCos’ monthly collection and made available for DisCos to purchase meters through 
a bulk one -off procurement or to cover the repayment of long -term vendor -financed meter deployments.  
SECOND  QUARTER 2025  NERC QUARTERLY REPORTS  
 
 
64   [NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION]  
 updates to the Commission on the resolution status of the complaints lodged through 
the NERC -CCU.  
B. DisCo Customer Complaint Unit (DisCo -CCU) : This is a department in a DisCo that 
is dedicated to the receipt and resolution of complaints directly from customers. 
DisCos submit monthly customer complaints reports which the Commission reviews 
to identify cases where regulatory intervention is neces sary. 
C. NERC Forum Offices:  Forum offices serve as the “court of second instance” for 
customers not happy with the resolution of their complaints at the DisCo -CCU. The 
Commission set up Forum Offices to hear and resolve customer complaints not 
satisfactorily resolved at the DisCo -CCUs.  
The Forum Office is managed by the Forum Secretariat while the hearings are 
conducted by five (5) forum panel members35, as stipulated in the Customer 
Protection Regulation (CPR) 2023. The forum panels hear and resolve customer 
complaints in the state in which it is situated. If there is no Forum Office in a state, 
the Commission determines which neighbouring Forum Office will oversee customer 
complaints from the state.  
As of 30 June 2025, the Commission has twenty -four (24)36 active Forum Offices 
across twenty -three (23) states and the FCT. The details, including names, addresses, 
and contacts of the operational Forum Offices , are contained in Appendix XV.  
 
35 The forum panel members are not staff of the Commission. The composition of the panel is as follows:  
1. A legal practitioner with experience in alternative dispute resolution nominated by the Nigerian Bar 
Association (NBA).  
2. A financial expert nominated by either the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Nigerian Association 
of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) or any other reputable 
organisation.  
3. A qualified electrical engineer nominated by either the Council for Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria 
(COREN) or the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE).  
4. A nominee of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC).  
5. A representative of an NGO based in the distribution company’s operating  area nominated by the 
Commission  
 
36 The Commission had 33 operational Forum Offices in 31 states and the FCT. However, due to the transfer of 
regulatory oversight to States, the Commission has closed down the 9 Forum Offices in the following States: 
Enugu, Imo, Ekiti, Oyo, Kogi, Lagos, Edo and Jigawa States .

 D. Power Outage Reporting System (PORS) : This is a mobile application designed 
for electricity customers to report outages in real time. The application is currently 
under a pilot and is exclusively available for customers under Abuja DisCo.    
4.3.1  NERC -CCU 
In 2025/Q2, 2,474 complaints were filed at the Commission’s CCU.  Customers of 
Ikeja and Eko DisCos lodged 932 and 516 complaints, accounting for 37.67% and 
20.86% of the total complaints lodged at NERC -CCU, respectively. Conversely, Aba 
Power (8) and Kano DisCo (8) had the lowest number o f complaints, respectively.  
Of the 2,474 complaints lodged at the NERC -CCU during the quarter, 1,129 were 
satisfactorily resolved by DisCos. This corresponds to a 45.63% resolution rate, 
representing an 8.36pp increase compared to the 37.27% resolution rate recorded 
in 2025/Q1. Kadun a (93.75%), Benin (83.72%), and Eko (81.98%) DisCos 
recorded resolution rates greater than 80%, while Ikeja DisCo recorded the lowest 
resolution rate (16.52%).  
The Commission notes the improvement in the complaint resolution rate by DisCos 
and will continue to take steps to enhance the speed of complaint resolution by 
DisCos.

 1,722 active appeals in the previous quarter (2025/Q1). The significant decrease 
in the number of active appeals in 2025/Q2 compared to 2025/Q1 can be 
attributed to the closure of Ikeja and Eko Forum Offices. Historically, these two ( 2) 
Forum Offices account for approximately 30% of active appeals in a quarter.  
Compared to 2025/Q1, the pending appeals carried over into 2025/Q2 
decreased by 166 ( -30.51%), while new appeals decreased by 138 ( -11.71%). The 
Forum Offices serving Ibadan DisCo have the highest number of active appeals 
(481), representing 33.92% of the total, while the Forum Office serving Aba has 
the fewest (6) in 2025/Q2.  
The total number of Forum sittings in 2025/Q2 decreased by 29.31% from 58 
sittings in 2025/Q1 to 41. Of the 1,418 active appeals across the Forum Offices, 
958 were resolved, translating to a 67.56% resolution rate. This is a 6.54pp 
decrease compared to the 74.10% resolution rate achieved in 2025/Q1.  
The reduction in the resolution rate is attributable to the decrease in sittings38; 
therefore, t he Commission will continue efforts to ensure that the forum panels sit 
regularly to increase the resolution rate and reduce the number of pending appeals 
carried over across quarters.
