ELECTRICITY SUPPLY LOGGER BOT - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
-------------
A web application that helps users track and monitor their electricity supply
in areas with unreliable power. Users can log when power goes ON or OFF, view
statistics, and analyze power availability patterns over time.

PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
------------------
In many regions (especially Nigeria), electricity supply is unpredictable.
People don't know:
- How many hours of power they get daily
- When power typically goes off
- How to plan activities around power availability
- How to hold utility companies accountable with data

SOLUTION APPROACH:
------------------
1. SIMPLE LOGGING: Users manually log power ON/OFF events via buttons or
   natural language commands ("power on", "power off")

2. AUTOMATIC TRACKING: System records timestamps and calculates total power
   hours by pairing ON and OFF events

3. DATA VISUALIZATION: Interactive charts show daily, weekly, and monthly
   power supply patterns

4. STATISTICS & REPORTS: Users get summaries of their power supply including
   total hours, averages, and trends

5. REGION MAPPING: Associates user locations with power distribution regions
   based on NERC (Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission) data

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
-------------------
FRONTEND (React):
- User interface for logging and viewing statistics
- Real-time updates every 30 seconds
- Interactive charts using Recharts library
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

BACKEND (Flask/Python):
- RESTful API for all operations
- JWT-based authentication for secure access
- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- Statistics calculation engine that pairs events and calculates hours

DATABASE (PostgreSQL):
- Stores user accounts, power logs, and region profiles
- Relational structure for efficient queries
- Automatic timestamp tracking

KEY FEATURES:
-------------
✓ User Registration & Login (with email verification)
✓ Manual Power Event Logging
✓ Statistics Calculation (daily/weekly/monthly)
✓ Interactive Charts & Visualizations
✓ Quick Reports
✓ Region-Based Power Distribution Data
✓ Google OAuth Login
✓ Random Data Generator (for testing/demos)

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. User registers and logs in
2. User clicks "Power ON" or "Power OFF" when electricity changes
3. System records event with timestamp
4. Statistics are calculated by pairing ON/OFF events and measuring time
5. Charts display power hours over selected time periods
6. Reports provide quick summaries

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
-----------------
Frontend: React, React Router, Axios, Recharts
Backend: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PyJWT
Database: PostgreSQL
Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

ARCHITECTURE:
-------------
Client-Server Architecture:
- React SPA (Single Page Application) as client
- Flask RESTful API as server
- PostgreSQL database for persistence
- JWT tokens for authentication

DATA FLOW:
----------
User Action → React Component → API Call → Flask Backend → Database → 
Response → React State Update → UI Re-render

STATISTICS CALCULATION:
-----------------------
The system calculates power supply hours by:
1. Retrieving all power logs for selected time period
2. Pairing ON events with subsequent OFF events
3. Calculating time difference between each pair
4. Summing hours for daily/weekly/monthly totals
5. Computing averages and trends

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
- Frontend hosted on Vercel (serverless)
- Backend hosted on Render (PaaS)
- PostgreSQL database on Render
- Automatic deployments from GitHub

USE CASES:
----------
- Personal power supply tracking
- Community electricity monitoring
- Research on power distribution patterns
- Accountability data for utility companies
- Planning activities around power availability

TARGET USERS:
-------------
- Individuals in areas with unreliable electricity
- Communities monitoring power supply
- Researchers studying power distribution
- Anyone wanting data-driven insights on electricity availability

BENEFITS:
---------
✓ Easy to use - simple button clicks
✓ Data-driven insights on power supply
✓ Historical tracking and trends
✓ Visual representation through charts
✓ Helps plan daily activities
✓ Provides evidence for utility complaints
